        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Disinformation is a threat worldwide and has become increasingly more dangerous as technology has enhanced. Since Social Media have become a prominent form of news communication, misinformation has spread through them from both malicious and uninformed actors. Disinformation campaigns start through organized efforts but have significant effects due to the unwitting participants who believe in and spread the claims originating from the campaign. As the information scene becomes more corrupted, the importance of creating solutions that protect against false information rises.
            Psychologists and political scientists are working on many different solutions that can help decrease the spread of false information. One such solution is inoculation theory, which refers to vaccinating against manipulative techniques. Disinformation Game employs inoculation techniques to protect its player base against misinformation. The game focuses on one individual as they form their own disinformation campaign against the current president. The player views and upgrades different manipulative and misinformative techniques based on Writing, History, and Technology to enhance their campaign. Throughout a playthrough, the player encounters multiple current events that they must take advantage of to spread their campaign. The player responds to these events by selecting tweets containing the most misinformation or the most convincing false claims. By putting players in positions where they have to learn about and identify misinformation, Disinformation Game trains the player base to become more vigilant in the future. All educational material in the skill trees and events has been added using a customizable Excel-based format that allows non-programmers to edit and enhance these materials easily. To balance the initial forms of this game, basic random and greedy agents were deployed on the model to understand baseline difficulty and playability.
